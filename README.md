# B-oddities
---

A repo for the occasional programs that are written in B for some reason; like a masochistic urge.\
Binaries will be provided in the respective folders along with the source code.

## How to compile
---
###### Honestly, this is pain to get compiling on even my device-

1) Get the B compiler from [here](https://github.com/Leushenko/ybc)
2) Just run `./ybc -o [DIR]/[SOURCE] [DIR]/[SOURCE].b`\
(Execute the compiler from where it is located; otherwise it will break for some reason)\
(Yes, even if you source it from your profile)
3) Suffer

A directory might also have another README if the above isn't sufficient.
